# Effects of normalization on mean-field 

This repository contains the code for the paper "On Bridging the Gap between Mean Field and Finite Width in Deep Random Multilayer Perceptron with Batch Normalization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13076), which will appear in proceedings of ICML 2023. 

The repository is organized as follows:
- theory_validation: contains the code to reproduce the theoretical results of the paper.
- training: contains the code to reproduce the training of MLP with batch normalization and the comparison with the without batch normalization case.
